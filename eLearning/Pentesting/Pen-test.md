### Life Cycle :

- [Information Gathering]()
- [Fingerprinting & Scanning ]()
- [Vlunerability Assessment]()
- [Exploitation]()
- [Reporting]()



### Information Gathering :

__General List__

    - WHOIS
    - DNS Information
    - Check live hosts by their IP
    - Check if one or more webites using the same IP
    - Services runnign on the network 
    - Open ports
    - OS running on hosts or servers

__Web Applicaiton__:

    - Domain
    - Sub Domain
    - Page (website crawling)
    - Technologies 
    - Langauges 
    - Frameworks and Content Managewment Systems 
    - Web Application Testing 


### Fingerprinting & Scanning 

__OS Fingerprinting:__

        - Fingerprinting OS helps narrow down the range of vulnerabilities and  
            exploitation 
        - Finding an approximate version of the OS
        - Level of patching

__Port Scanning:__

        - Open ports
        - Type of services on the ports
        -

### Life Cycle :

- [Information Gathering]()
- [Fingerprinting & Scanning ]()
- [Vlunerability Assessment]()
- [Exploitation]()
- [Reporting]()


### Information Gathering :

__General List__

    - WHOIS
    - DNS Information
    - Check live hosts by their IP
    - Check if one or more webites using the same IP
    - Services runnign on the network 
    - Open ports
    - OS running on hosts or servers
    
    - Checking Items:
            - Emails
            - Phone numbers
            - websites
            - Addresses
            - Social Media : LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, CrunchBase,
    
    Whoeis:
        - use the command whois in Linux and OSX to find the general information                about a domain
            Ex: whois www.apple.com
        
        - For Windows, Sysinternal Whois
            
__Web Applicaiton__:

    - Domain
    - Sub Domain
    - Page (website crawling)
    - Technologies 
    - Langauges 
    - Frameworks and Content Managewment Systems 
    - Web Application Testing 


### Fingerprinting & Scanning 

__OS Fingerprinting:__

        - Fingerprinting OS helps narrow down the range of vulnerabilities and  
            exploitation 
        - Finding an approximate version of the OS
        - Level of patching

__Port Scanning:__

        - Open ports
        - Type of services on the ports
        - Knowing the running service can infer:
            - OS 
            - IP address inference (server IP or Client IP )
            - Types of servers --> Databases, Web, Email
    
 __General Items__
 
        - Routers
        - Firewalls
        - Hosts
        - Services 
        - Printers
        - Ports

>> You can perform the fingerprinting passively (through analyzing wireshark stored pcap file) or Actively unsing POF


__Port status__:

- if packets are flaged with RST means that the port is __closed__
- if packets compeleted the handshake, then sent RST flag means the port is __open__
- Every TCP connection (__full handshake__)is logged into the system and can be detectable 
- __TCP syn__ is a stealthy way to scan the ports. Sending Syn packets to the target and analyze the results 
    >>> The TCP-SYN sends a SYN packet to the target, if it gets RST, it means that the port is closed.

    >>> if the packets are returned with ACK flags mean that the port is open. Therefore, in this case the scanner send RST packet to force close the connection and not compelete the connection.
    
- Since there was NO complete handshake, no logs were recorded on the system.

__Daemon__:

>> is a service running on a server with specific port.
Port scanning helps discover daemon service on the network.


>> When running port scanning, if the daemon is not running or running on different ports, TCP packets are sent with RST flag




__Figuring out the scope of address__:

- 16 bit long netmask means 65536 hosts
- To detemine which IP addresses are assigned to hosts, use __ping sweep__

- __Ping Sweep Tool__:
        - Fping is a Linux tool 
        
            Ex: fping -a -g IPRANGE 
        
            - a for returning live hosts
            - g for peforeming ping sweeps instead of regular pings
            EX:
                fping -a -g 10.54.12/24
        - Fping also return offline hosts despite the option -a on LAN, to weed out offline hosts while performing the ping sweep use /dev/null
        
        EX: fping -a -g 192.136.82.0 192.168.82.66 2>/dev/null

__Tools__:

- P0f: 
- Nmap 
- Zmap [Nmap GUI]


### Vulnerability Assessment :
    
    - Can be manually or automatically using automted tools 
    - Tools can include Scanners, Fuzzers

### Exploitation :

    >> is the last stage after gathering information and enumerating the systems            multiple times
